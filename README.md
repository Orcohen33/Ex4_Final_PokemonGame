# About this project
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
In this project we need to implement a Pokemon game, which runs on a given external server.
The score is determined by the efficiency of the algorithm by catching as many Pokemons as possible at the given time for us at each stage.
We use a project we've already created to use search and GUI algorithms.

Our main challenge was to satisfy the consumer request. The ultimate goal of the project is to run the game and get the best score that can be given to the customer, plus a GUI that can be used conveniently and clearly.

       Make sure you have all the needed documents including readme, algorithm definition, class diagram, “how to run”, results, tests (unitest / junit), and some images (and a short clip) as a wiki (github) project. Make sure there is a working release available for download, and a short clip
